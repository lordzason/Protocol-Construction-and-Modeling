# Protocol-Construction-and-Modeling-
The objective this time is to implement the two sides of a protocol in which one side (the client) poses a question and the other (the server) answers it, in such a way that eavesdroppers cannot determine either the question or the answer. 

To run the program, clone this repository into a desired directory.
In a terminal window move to the location where the source files cloned are
located if not already there and type 'make'.


Note that the file dependencies for the program can be viewed from the file 'MakeFile'
