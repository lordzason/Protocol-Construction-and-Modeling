Steps:

1.In a terminal window, move to the required directory.
2.Type into the terminal at the required directory:
       git clone https://github.com/lordzason/Protocol-Construction-and-Modeling
3. Follow given instructions from git about username and password
4. A working directory will be created as 'Protocol-Construction-and-Modeling
   -->   Downloading of the package may take a while. Check progress percentage

EXAMPLE:
1. cd /home/USER/Protocols
2. git clone https://github.com/lordzason/Protocol-Construction-and-Modeling
3  Username for 'https://github.com': myusername
   Password for 'https://myusername@github.com': ********

**What the program does:
-----------------------

Overview: 
The objective this time is to implement the two sides of a protocol in
which one side (the client) poses a question and the other (the server)
answers it, in such a way that eavesdroppers cannot determine either the
question or the answer.



       Program files and directories:
-----------------------------------
As a whole the program uses the following files:

----------
header files:



The Program is devided into 4 parts:

 0.) Sever Initialisation
 1.) Client send initial message
 2.) Server decrypts client's message and encrypts new message
 3.) 



 0. Server Initialisation
------------------------------

To kick start the protocol the server must initialise some of its key
utilities. Firstly for the sake of the first round of communication, the
server generates a "dummy" keypair which it makes available to all clients.
The server then generates its actual keypair, making the public key
available to all prospective clients and keeping the secret key private.
At this stage the first time nonce is also created and made available
to all clients.

The entire process is implemented as "server_start_first_time_init()" 
please see Server.h or Server.c for more details

*You may notice that in "server_start_first_time_init()" we generate an
additional nonce which will be used in the next round of communication.



1. Client send initial message
---------------------------------------

Here the client sends the server its public key and the nonce for the next
communication to the server. 

The first step is to generate the clients keypair. Using
"crypto_box_keypair", we generate both the client's secrete and public
keys. The encryption of the information and the sending of the encypted
message to file is done by "client_encrypt_nonce_pk_send".






Working on a general concatenate function that will take in 3 parameters
nonce current, nonce next, and the message and for the 1 step in the client
send initial message.

the idea is that every message that we will send in this protocol is going 
to have the form 

zb+ nonce before +nonce after + message
